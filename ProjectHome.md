Aim of the project is to develop a real-time end-to-end stereo streaming system.You can find all the abstract,design and implementation details here on this page.We divided the project in two part.First part is called the static phase,where the system is based on static images,and the second part is called real-time phase,where system is based on real-time stream.Below,all the documents on Wiki Page are classified.System is designed and implemented in Fontys Robotics Laboratory as a part of Remote Robotics Project.
